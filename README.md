# xiboserver_installer
A simple script and some confs to install a Xibo Signage server the easy way.

### Pre-requisities :
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, a fresh install is recommended.
* Your brain.
* A lot of coffee (Especially if you are on a poor broadband internet access)
* This script.

*Usage :*

Easy to use, you just have to download the script and execute it with this comand :

```sh
wget https://github.com/vparres/xiboserver_installer/raw/master/xiboserver_install.sh -O /tmp/xiboserver_install.sh && /tmp/xiboserver_install.sh
```

You can grab a coffee until installation ends.
During MySQL installation you will have to choose your password, so keep an eye on the screen.
After script execution, you can finish xibo-cms install throught your favorite web browser.

## The fate of this script ...

I have done this to help some Trainees like the one i'm to install xibo-cms without effort.
This should not be used in production environement as it, trust me.
If your server is destroyed by this script or by Xibo, forgive me, but i cannot be responsible for it.

***Have fun !***
